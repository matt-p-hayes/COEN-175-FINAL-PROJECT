# COEN-175-FINAL-PROJECT
## Overview
A compiler for a simplified version of C. This project was completed in phases culminating in the final compiler completed suring phase 6.

## Phases
- Phase 1: Lexical Analysis - Used Flex to generate a scanner for the Simple C language
- Phase 2: Syntax Analysis - Developed a recursive-descent parser for the Simple C language
- Phase 3: Symbol Table Construction - Augmented parser to construct a symbol table for the Simple C language
- Phase 4: Type Checking - Augmented parser to perform type checking for the Simple C language
- Phase 5: Storage Allocation - Extended compiler to generate code for Linux
- Phase 6: Code Generation - Extended compiler to generate code for Linux
